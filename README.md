### Project Name
Reactor simulation
# Idea
I’m a chemical engineering student I’m taking a kinetic and chemical reactors course and this course distinguishes the chemical engineer from other engineers
So I had this idea of making a reactor simulation to calculate the final concentration and plot it vs time and show the difference between batch and flow reactors 


# Future Work 
I would like to add descriptions of the different types of flow reactors (CSTR, PFR, and PBR) to the application. In addition, I would like to enhance the visual appeal of the app by implementing color schemes. Finally, I would like to include a feature that allows users to calculate the rate of the reactors.
